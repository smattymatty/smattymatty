# Mathew Storm

**Not the basketball player.** Software developer, philosophical author, and unraveling recursive absurdism one paradox at a time.

## Philosophy

Every line of code is a moral choice. Every pull request embodies values. Every mentorship session transmits not just technical knowledge but philosophical understanding.

## Engineering

- **[Django Spellbook](https://django-spellbook.org/)** - Transform markdown into Django apps with magical simplicity
- **[80-20 Human-in-the-Loop](https://github.com/80-20-Human-In-The-Loop/Community/wiki)** - Where humans lead with 20% effort, AI amplifies with 80% power
- **Tech Philosophy** - Engineering meets existentialism at the command line. My code comments are mini-essays. My documentation teaches why, not just how.

## Current Focus

- Writing "The Labyrinth of Sisyphus" - recursive philosophy for the AI age - [Read the First Chapter](https://mathewstorm.ca/philo/book/Chapter%201%20-%20The%20Arrival/)
